# Exploratory Data Analysis on Supermarket Data
This project involves exploring and analyzing a dataset from a supermarket to derive insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and other relevant factors. The analysis encompasses various aspects of data exploration, visualization, and statistical examination. 

## Technical Stack:
- **Python Libraries:**
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## **Dataset obtained from:-**

Below are the key components of the analysis:

### 01. Initial Data Exploration
- The dataset is loaded and inspected to understand its structure and features.
- Data types are checked and necessary conversions are performed.
- Categorical and numerical features are identified.

### 02. Univariate Analysis
- **Distribution Analysis:** 
  - Examination of the distribution of customer ratings and various numerical variables.
- **Branch and Payment Analysis:** 
  - Investigation into sales across different branches and payment methods.
- **Product Line Analysis:** 
  - Exploration of sales trends among different product lines.

### 03. Bivariate Analysis
- **Relationship Analysis:** 
  - Examination of the relationship between gross income and customer ratings, gross income across branches, and gross income across genders.
- **Time Trend Analysis:** 
  - Analysis of gross income trends over time to identify any temporal patterns.
- **Pairwise Comparison:** 
  - Comparison of numerical variables to uncover potential correlations.

### 04. Dealing with Data Quality Issues
- **Handling Duplicates:** 
  - Identification and removal of duplicate rows in the dataset.
- **Missing Values:** 
  - Detection and imputation of missing values using appropriate strategies.

### 05. Correlation Analysis
- Exploration of correlations between different variables to understand their relationships and dependencies.
